# Image Map

This app integrates with your photo library, and camera, to create a single app where you can take photos and view all of the photos in your camera roll on a geo map.

## Libraries Used

The bulk of the image clustering was done using a library found at https://github.com/ribl/FBAnnotationClusteringSwift.  The library was customized to suit the apps particular needs.
