/// The image class provides the infrastructure for managing a captured asset of type PHAssetMediaType.Image as an MKAnnotation.
///
/// This class is almost never subclassed, but instances are often created.
///
/// When an image object is created:
///
///     // anAsset in this example is an asset of type PHAssetMediaType.Image
///     // and imageFetchedFromAnAsset is a UIImage fetched using PHImageManager.defaultManager().requestImageForAsset()
///     let myImageObject: Image = Image(date: anAsset.creationDate!, coordinate: anAsset.location.coordinate, image: imageFetchedFromAnAsset, asset: anAsset)
/// it can be added directly to a map as an annotation. For example:
///
///     // mapView is a reference to MKMapView
///     mapView.addAnnotation(myImageObject)
///
/// - parameters:
///   - date: An NSDate object to attach to the Image object.  Image.shortDate, and Image.shortTime string properties are created from this parameter.
///   - coordinate: A CLLocationCoordinate2D object to attach to the Image object. **When the Image object is added to the map as an annotation, coordinate specifies where it will be added to.**
///   - image: A UIImage to attach to the Image object.  If you are never going to need a new UIImage from the asset this can make a large performance difference (instead of requesting a new UIImage from the asset, refer to this property).
///   - asset: A PHAssetMediaType.Image asset to attach to the Image object.  If you need to request a new UIImage use this property to get the asset.
